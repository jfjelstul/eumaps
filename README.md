`eumaps` makes it easy to make professional-quality choropleth maps of the European Union (EU) with only a few lines of code — and without knowing anything about map-making.

`eumaps` breaks down the process of making a map into three basic steps: (1) specifying the geography to plot, (2) specifying the color palette to use, and (3) specifying a theme that defines the aesthetics of the map.

`eumaps` includes a wide array of intuitive customization options. And it’s based on `ggplot`, so the output is customizable.
